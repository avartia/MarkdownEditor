<body><h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS

<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>

<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS

<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>

<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS

<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>

<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS

<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>

<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>

<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<li>Check out the git repository from <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim">github</a>.</li>
<li>Get the source code as an <a href="https://github.com/vim/vim/releases">archive</a>.</li>
<li>Get a Windows executable from the
<br  /><a href="https://github.com/vim/vim-win32-installer/releases">vim-win32-installer</a> repository.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compiling</h2>
<p>If you obtained a binary distribution you don't need to compile Vim.  If you
<br  />obtained a source distribution, all the stuff for compiling Vim is in the
<br  /><code>src</code> directory.  See <code>src/INSTALL</code> for instructions.</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>See one of these files for system-specific instructions.  Either in the
<br  />READMEdir directory (in the repository) or the top directory (if you unpack an
<br  />archive):</p>
<pre><code>README_ami.txt      Amiga
README_unix.txt     Unix
README_dos.txt      MS-DOS and MS-Windows
README_mac.txt      Macintosh
README_vms.txt      VMS
</code></pre>
<p>There are other <code>README_*.txt</code> files, depending on the distribution you used.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Vim tutor is a one hour training course for beginners.  Often it can be
<br  />started as <code>vimtutor</code>.  See <code>:help tutor</code> for more information.</p>
<p>The best is to use <code>:help</code> in Vim.  If you don't have an executable yet, read
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/help.txt</code>.  It contains pointers to the other documentation
<br  />files.  The User Manual reads like a book and is recommended to learn to use
<br  />Vim.  See <code>:help user-manual</code>.</p>
<h2>Copying</h2>
<p>Vim is Charityware.  You can use and copy it as much as you like, but you are
<br  />encouraged to make a donation to help orphans in Uganda.  Please read the file
<br  /><code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code> for details (do <code>:help uganda</code> inside Vim).</p>
<p>Summary of the license: There are no restrictions on using or distributing an
<br  />unmodified copy of Vim.  Parts of Vim may also be distributed, but the license
<br  />text must always be included.  For modified versions a few restrictions apply.
<br  />The license is GPL compatible, you may compile Vim with GPL libraries and
<br  />distribute it.</p>
<h2>Sponsoring</h2>
<p>Fixing bugs and adding new features takes a lot of time and effort.  To show
<br  />your appreciation for the work and motivate Bram and others to continue
<br  />working on Vim please send a donation.</p>
<p>Since Bram is back to a paid job the money will now be used to help children
<br  />in Uganda.  See <code>runtime/doc/uganda.txt</code>.  But at the same time donations
<br  />increase Bram's motivation to keep working on Vim!</p>

<h2>What is Vim?</h2>
<p>Vim is a greatly improved version of the good old UNIX editor Vi.  Many new
<br  />features have been added: multi-level undo, syntax highlighting, command line
<br  />history, on-line help, spell checking, filename completion, block operations,
<br  />script language, etc.  There is also a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
<br  />available.  Still, Vi compatibility is maintained, those who have Vi &ldquo;in the
<br  />fingers&rdquo; will feel at home.  See <code>runtime/doc/vi_diff.txt</code> for differences with
<br  />Vi.</p>
<p>This editor is very useful for editing programs and other plain text files.
<br  />All commands are given with normal keyboard characters, so those who can type
<br  />with ten fingers can work very fast.  Additionally, function keys can be
<br  />mapped to commands by the user, and the mouse can be used.</p>
<p>Vim runs under MS-Windows (NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10), Macintosh, VMS and
<br  />almost all flavours of UNIX.  Porting to other systems should not be very
<br  />difficult.  Older versions of Vim run on MS-DOS, MS-Windows 95/98/Me, Amiga
<br  />DOS, Atari MiNT, BeOS, RISC OS and OS/2.  These are no longer maintained.</p>
<h2>Distribution</h2>
<p>You can often use your favorite package manager to install Vim.  On Mac and
<br  />Linux a small version of Vim is pre-installed, you still need to install Vim
<br  />if you want more features.</p>
<p>There are separate distributions for Unix, PC, Amiga and some other systems.
<br  />This <code>README.md</code> file comes with the runtime archive.  It includes the
<br  />documentation, syntax files and other files that are used at runtime.  To run
<br  />Vim you must get either one of the binary archives or a source archive.
<br  />Which one you need depends on the system you want to run it on and whether you
<br  />want or must compile it yourself.  Check http://www.vim.org/download.php for
<br  />an overview of currently available distributions.</p>
<p>Some popular places to get the latest Vim:</p>
<ul>
